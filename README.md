nginxconfig
===========

A simple C++ library for dealing with [nginx](http://nginx.com/) server configuration files.
Since your `nginx.conf` file is not written using a standard-issue file format (JSON, XML, YAML), editing it in software
 can be a little obnoxious.
This library is meant to help you parse and output an `nginx.conf` file in C++.
